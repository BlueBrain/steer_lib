This document describes the environment variables that the
RealityGrid steering software requires to be set at 
run-time. (SGS = Steering Grid Service; only used when
steering via SOAP.)  Angle brackets indicate that a given
variable does not have to be set but may be used to 
configure the behaviour of the library.

Initial version: A R Porter, 13th October 2003.

-------------------------------
REG_STEER_HOME 

Root directory for library installation

-------------------------------
REG_STEER_DIRECTORY 

Directory location to use for steering communication

-------------------------------
<REG_APP_POLL_INTERVAL>

Minimum time interval (integer no. of seconds) between checks on 
whether a steering client has connected.  If set to zero then a 
check is performed on every call to Steering_control.  If unset
then a default value (set in ReG_Steer_types.h) is used.

-------------------------------
<REG_CONNECTOR_HOSTNAME>

Hostname of machine to connect to (using globus_io)
Note that this is published in the SGS if steering via SOAP &
thus this variable need not be set.

-------------------------------
<REG_CONNECTOR_PORT> 

Port on machine REG_CONNECTOR_HOSTNAME to connect to (using globus_io)
Note that this is published in the SGS if steering via SOAP & thus
this variable need not be set.

-------------------------------
<GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE   2566,2586>

Used by both globus_io and gSOAP - specifies a range of ports that may
be opened on the client machine.  Port chosen at random if not set.

-------------------------------
REG_SGS_ADDRESS

Location of steering grid service that provides public interface for
steering simulation and discovering address of remote data sources.
Required only if the steering library has been built to use SOAP
(see Makefile.include) for remote steering.

-------------------------------
<REG_TCP_INTERFACE>

For use when machine hosting simulation/visualisation has more than
one TCP interface.  Set to IP address of desired interface to use for
globus_io.  Uses default if not set (i.e. probably INADDR_ANY).

-------------------------------
<REG_MACHINE_NAME>

The address of a publicly-accessible node on the machine we're
executing on.  On many machines we may be running on a node that
cannot be seen by the outside world and therefore globus connections
for file transfer etc. will need the address of a publicly-accessible
node.  This assumes that the port-forwarder (used for both steering
and globus_io connections) runs on the same node as that to be used
for gsiftp access.
  If this isn't set then REG_TCP_INTERFACE is used.  If that isn't
set then uname and gethostbyname are used to get the fully-qualified
domain name of the node we're executing on.  
  This variable only affects what address the SGS (and checkpoint 
data) publishes to the outside world - it does not alter which local 
interface is used by socket connections.
