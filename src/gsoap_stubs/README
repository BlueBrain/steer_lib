The contents of this directory are for those wishing to develop/extend
the gSoap-generated SOAP bindings that the steering library uses.  If
all you want to do is build and use the steering library then you can
ignore this directory and its contents.

The definitions of the interfaces that are used are in the all_hdrs.h
header file (which itself includes other header files for each
Web/Grid service that the library talks to).  This header file is
processed by the gSoap soapcpp2 tool in order to generate the bindings
in the form of the files:
  soapC.c
  soapClient.c
  soapH.h
  soapStub.h
  *.nsmap

The current bindings have been generated under linux using gSoap
2.7.6e.  To generate bindings yourself, you will need to install gSoap
and then edit the Makefile in this directory in order to specify the
location of the soapcpp2 executable.  Once that is done, typing 'make'
should be sufficient to generate the bindings.  If you are changing
the version of gSoap that is used then you will also need to update
the reg_steer_lib/include/stdsoap2.h and reg_steer_lib/src/stdsoap2.c
files.  To do this you will need to slightly modify the standard
gSoap-supplied versions of those files - search for 'ARPDBG' in the
versions of those files supplied with the steering library.

Once new bindings have been generated, the source files need to be
copied to the reg_steer_lib/src directory and the header files to the
reg_steer_lib/include directory. Any one of the generated *.nsmap files 
(they are all identical) should be copied to:
      reg_steer_lib/include/soapRealityGrid.nsmap.
