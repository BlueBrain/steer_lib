According to WSRF spec., messages should contain
a wsa:To element in the SOAP:Header.
wsa=http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing/
Need to alter gSoap headers so this element is
included. - DONE - need to test...

Continue working on altering reg_wsrf_tools to 
work with latest form of secure api.

Rename Create_WSSE_header to Create_WSRF_header
to indicate that it doesn't just do security now.

Remove some unecessary malloc's from the
WSRF steering code.
