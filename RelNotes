 * Fix HybridThread output messages.
 * Improve error handling on start-up of the proxy.
 * Fix the parts of logging that were missed during modularization.
 * Fix invalid XML schema and invalid XML messages.

Version 3.0.1
-------------

 * Updates and corrections to the inline doxygen document comments in the code.
 * When building docs, the images for the main page need to be copied to the build tree.
 * Add the example codes into the doxygen process.

 Internal changes
 ----------------

 * Updates to the automatic documentation build rules.
 * Remove a couple of very old and out of date doc files that refer to version 1.0.

Version 3.0.0
-------------

 * Add option to build either static or shared libraries.
 * Create modularization framework and modularize "Samples" transport code.
 * Modularization of "Steering" transport code.
 * Modularize IOProxy Samples Transport code.
 * Remove Consume_start_impl() from the Samples Transport API.
 * Make the building of a monolithic library the default.
 * Implement mechanism for modularized transport introspection.
 * Turn off some debug output that was printed from a non-debug build.
 * Update the licence in each file. Also add a LICENCE file at the top-level.

 Internal changes
 ----------------

 * Convert files with DOS CRLF line endings to standard UNIX LF.
 * Sink example IO Channel name updated to match that which mini_app uses.
 * Move towards centralized cross-platform and library feature checks.
 * Use REG_HAS_MSG_NOSIGNAL to correctly handle the use of flags versus signals for send().
 * Use REG_HAS_MSG_DONTWAIT to correctly implement a cross-platform non-blocking recv.
 * Make the finding and linkage of external library dependencies consistent.
 * Convert creation of lock files from using 'touch' to creat().
 * Convert listing of files in a directory from using 'ls' to c library functions.
 * Grid Services code removed and gSoap bindings updated to version 2.7.13.
 * Build system improvements relating to modularization work.
 * Require OpenSSL for WSRF Steering so that we can always use HTTPS or WSSE if required.
 * Move the platform dependency checks to their own directory.
 * Add a per-module build step so that each module can have custom build steps.
 * Added a framework in which to do platform specific configuration.
 * Move 'utility' code to more appropriate files after modularization.
 * Remove the proxy code for "grid" (WSRF) steering.
 * Remove all the files that we no longer use.
 * Test to ensure that the user specifies something sensible as module choices.
 * Use REG_HAS_MSG_WAITALL to correctly implement a cross-platform blocking recv.
 * Add a small check to prevent REG_DEBUG_FULL being ON if REG_DEBUG is OFF.
 * Minor changes to some build system code.
 * ReG_Steer_Common.h did not include ReG_Steer_types.h ...

Version 2.5.0
-------------

 * Added REG_DOUBLE to the coding scheme for data types to match REG_DBL.

 Internal changes
 ----------------

 * Very minor change to the project() declaration in the top-level CMakeLists.txt
 * Minor change to the application-side signal handler to ignore SEGV signals.


Version 2.5.0-rc2
-----------------

 * Major changes to mini_app example to output more interesting data.
  - This was done to allow mini_app to be used as an example data
    source for visualization programs using RealityGrid.
 * Minor updates to mini_steerer to make working with direct socket
   connections easier.
 * Added steering message "catch-up" functionality so that user
   doesn't have to keep prodding steerer.

 Internal changes
 ----------------

 * Added an "install type" variable to distinguish build tree and
   fully installed versions.
  - Useful for projects that want to use or extend this one via CMake.


Version 2.5.0-rc1
-----------------

 * Direct TCP Steering connections added.

 Internal changes
 ----------------

 * Changed the build machinery from Make to CMake.
