This software is an implementation of the steering API for the
RealityGrid project, produced by the Supercomputing, Visualization &
e-Science Group, Manchester Computing, University of Manchester.  It
uses libxml2, the XML parser created by the Gnome Project and gSOAP, an
implementation of the Simple Object Access Protocol from Florida State
University.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to install:

The XML parser.

The steering library uses libxml2, the XML C library for Gnome.  This
is available from http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html and should be
installed (including the header files) on your machine before
attempting to install the steering library itself.

(Note, you'll need to set the CFLAGS environment variable to "-mabi=64" to
get a 64-bit library on an SGI.  Configure should also be run with the 
following flags:

--with-python=no --with-threads=no --with-xpath=no --with-xptr=no --enable-shared=no flag

If you don't have the access rights to install the library in a system-default
location and don't want to have to set LD_LIBRARY64_PATH/LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH
then you can also specify that you only want a static library by giving the
--enable-shared=no flag.)

gSOAP

The library distribution includes gSOAP, version 2.2.3.  If for any reason
you wish to change the version of gSOAP used then the relevant files are:

src/stdsoap2.c
include/stdsoap2.h

The following files are generated from the WSDL describing the Steering
Grid Service (available in the OGSI::Lite distribution):

src/soapC.c
src/soapClient.c
include/soapH.h
include/soapStub.h
include/soapSGS.nsmap

UNICORE (grid-services related) stuff.

Note that this section is only relevant if you will be steering
withing the UNICORE middleware framework.

In order to interface with the UNICORE framework, the steering library
launches a Java proxy that communicates with the UNICORE framework (if
available).  As a result, you will require GLUE from The Mind Electric
installed on your system as well as the ReG-grid-service software
(should be available from the same source as this library itself).

You should make the additions to your CLASSPATH environment variable
specified in the GLUE documentation.  The additions required for the
ReG-grid-service are dealt with in the reg_steer_configure.csh file -
you should edit these as appropriate.  More about this file below.

The steering library.

The directory containing this README file should also contain a file called
reg_steer_configure.csh.  This sets some environment variables
to configure the steering system:

REG_STEER_HOME: should be set to the path of the directory that contains
	        this file.

REG_STEER_DIRECTORY: set this to point to an existing directory that will
	             be used as a communication channel between the app.
	  	     and the steerer (i.e. all messages are written and
	  	     read from this directory).  This information will be
                     discarded if the UNICORE framework is being used.

REG_XML_LIBDIR: The root location of the xml library file (libxml2.a) to link
                against.  NOTE that the actual location is generated by 
	        concatenating either 32 or 64 to the supplied string (depending
                on the type of binary being generated). So, if I had a 64-bit
	        version of the library in directory "/home/me/xml_lib64" then
                I would set REG_XML_LIBDIR to "/home/me/xml_lib".

REG_XML_INCDIR: The path of the libxml 'include' directory.
                (e.g. /usr/freeware/include/libxml2.)

Executing 'source reg_steer_configure.csh' (or equivalent, depending
on which shell you use) will then set these variables.  Since this
needs to be done everytime you log in, it may be wise to add this
command to your .cshrc or equivalent.

All platform-dependent build configuration is done in the file
Makefile.include to be found in this directory.

You should select 64- or 32-bit compilation (if appropriate for you
platform). (Ensure that you have a compatible libxml2 library file.)

Set architecture type (necessary for generating F90 bindings).

Specify compilers and compiler flags...

Type 'make' in the current directory...bear in mind that the makefiles etc.
are not currently platform independent and may require tweaking.

Included in the distribution are 'mini_steerer', 'mini_app',
'mini_app2' and 'mini_app_para' (an MPI version) which are _very_
simple applications designed to show how one might make an application
steerable and how one might write a steerer with which to control it.
'mini_steerer' in particular is really just to give an idea - its
functionality is truly primitive and often hard-wired. 'mini_app2' is
similar to 'mini_app' but implemented in F90 instead of C. 'mini_app_para'
is a parallel (F90 and MPI) example.
