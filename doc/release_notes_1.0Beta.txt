Version 1.0 Beta

The steering API has undergone some slight modifications.  As a 
result:

1) (F90 only) Strings passed to the steering library should be declared
   as being LESS than REG_MAX_STRING_LENGTH characters long;

2) (F90 only) There is no longer any need to terminate strings (being 
   passed to the library) with CHAR(0);

3) (F90 only) The register_params_f has been modified to reflect the
   fact that it is only ever possible to register one parameter at a 
   time from F90.  One consequence is that it has been RENAMED 
   register_param_f.

   In addition, the first argument specifying the no. of parameters
   being registered has been removed (since this always had to be set 
   to 1).

   It has two new arg.'s immediately before final (status) argument:
      string for min value (empty or blank for none)
      string for max value (empty or blank for none)
   These limits are only applied if the parameter is steerable. They
   are visible in the latest steerer gui as pop-ups (tool-tips).

4) register_params has also had these two arguments added at the 
   end of the existing argument list;

5) (F90 only) CHARACTER-type parameters must now be registered using 
   the new register_string_param_f routine;

6) emit_start_f - the third argument of this routine (specifying whether 
   or not to use XDR) has been removed (lib. now uses XDR by default).

As usual, take a look at examples/mini_app_f90/mini_app2.f90 for
clarification.

Known issues:

When the library is compiled as 64-bit with the -O2 (or higher) flag
under IRIX calls to globus_io routines can hang.  This is under
investigation but for the present use the -O1 flag if compiling a
64-bit version of the library with globus_io.
