This README describes the "ioProxy" - a piece of software that allows software
components to send data to one another using sockets without having to connect
to one another directly.  Such functionality is useful when one or both of
the components are running on hosts whose firewalls do not permit incoming
socket connections.

The ioProxy is derived from the "HybridSwitch" originally written by
Matt Harvey to facilitate data exchange between the components of
coupled models.  It has been extended to form the ioProxy by Andrew Porter
at the University of Manchester.

---------------------------------------

Usage:

java HybridSwitch <port on which to listen>

The steering library must be compiled with the correct options in
order for it to do its data IO via an ioProxy: edit the
Makefile.include file and set the REG_PROXY_SAMPLES_FLAG to 1 and the
REG_SOCKET_SAMPLES_FLAG to 0.  Finally, execute a 'make clean' followed
by a 'make'.

The Steering Web Service (SWS) representing a simulation must be configured
with information on the location (address and port no.) of the ioProxy. See
the README in the reg_wsrf_tools repository for information on how to use
createSWS to do this.
